- The initial commit for this repo not a lot was done besides starting it. I have a blank screen appearing
  and that is about it. I currently don't have much of an idea for the game, probably going to do some 2D
  platformer because it seems like a good start.

- Wow I really need to work on this more. Today I was able to make it so that the window size is 640x480
  as I feel like that is a good size to start with. I also figured out how to make it so the window will
  always make itself in the middle of the screen. Lastly, I added a main panel along with a label in order
  to add text to the screen. The next few things planned will be event listeners and refreshing the screen.
